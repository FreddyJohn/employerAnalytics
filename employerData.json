Our corporate training events usually involve copious amounts of alcohol and firearms ... in that order. This is not a joke, nor is it intended \"to try make us sound like badasses.\" We actually enjoy what we do and we believe that it helps promote the creative process and the business as a whole. Photographic evidence can be found on social media.The rXg runs premier sites worldwide... including the busiest airports in the world, stadiums where teams you've heard of (and are on prime time OTA TV) play, piles of hotels and time shares in beautiful and exotic locations ... and as an employee you can volunteer to help with these installs. The selfies you will take while doing this are priceless.RG Nets is a high intensity environment and a meritocracy. We pay market rates to start. If you deserve a raise because you exceed our very high expectations, you will get it, on the spot. People who have worked with us for a while make far higher than market rates.There are some people who enjoy disparaging us. Some of these folks are quite vocal and spew their crap all over the Internet as well as in person. We don't care. We've been busy making a magnificent product and running a profitable company (no external investors) for the past 15 consecutive years. We are busy changing the world, every single day. We are looking for people who are thick skinned and like minded.RG Nets has been a fully remote work environment for all employees since its inception. Other people are trying to figure out remote work. We've had it figured out for over a decade. People work when they can. People take off when they want to. We all get what we need to get done, that's all that matters.You probably ought to read-up about RG Nets before you apply, because if you do apply, you may get a call within a few minutes, yes even on a weekend or late at night... because we are always working. If we call you then you should be ready to have in depth discussions about what we do immediately.You should probably make the effort to contact us directly. You should write us a cover letter. In this cover letter should be a link code you have written. If you just push a button to say you are interested, it's highly unlikely that your application will be considered. Tell us why you want to work with us.Job Type: Full-timePay: $135,000.00 - $250,000.00 per yearBenefits:Dental insuranceFlexible scheduleHealth insuranceProfessional development assistanceVision insuranceSchedule:10 hour shift12 hour shift8 hour shiftDay shiftMonday to FridayNight shiftWeekendsSupplemental Pay:Bonus payExperience:Ruby: 3 years (Required)APIs: 1 year (Required)Rails: 3 years (Required)Perl: 1 year (Preferred)Firewalls: 1 year (Required)Ethernet Switch Configuration: 1 year (Required)UNIX: 5 years (Required)License/Certification:CWNA (Preferred)CCNA (Preferred)Work Location:Fully RemoteOn the roadVisa Sponsorship Potentially Available:No: Not providing sponsorship for this jobThis Company Describes Its Culture as:Detail-oriented -- quality and precision-focusedInnovative -- innovative and risk-takingOutcome-oriented -- results-focused with strong performance cultureThis Job Is:A job for which military experienced candidates are encouraged to applyA good fit for applicants with gaps in their resume, or who have been out of the workforce for the past 6 months or moreA good job for someone just entering the workforce or returning to the workforce with limited experience and educationA job for which all ages, including older job seekers, are encouraged to applyCompany's website:rgnets.com - 4 days agoreport jobIf you require alternative methods of application or screening, you must approach the employer directly to request this as Indeed is not responsible for the employer's application process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "embedded_url": "https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?viewtype=embedded&jk=a40b751b4e36fb3b&from=vjs&tk=1em2mgp9mp64q800&advn=7517322631805206&adid=360824975&ad=-6NYlbfkN0Cew60MUYfPqaj14VEPlb9Cdkf1onehFWycK6eNTtJwFUI_L50PehGivhD6k541vnBgbeewHcFVmtsuFlullWm1mNb_7pIsaMCNvOb-_vdUwiwsKgAhI3I2dvAhTS7TktvWuqvKQX4scjmNiJqta9H3CD6GEEYQJQsTcFuzQ72ZhGu37QIJqM7C7VEYzU9Is_8bfIp2z6hKLC1mpiz3OCjku7hUA8swGQ1B7AE1hUc2JRHBBiDtGX7s0q4Moyt1Eiq_oYzs3qAzfFE_vqKMFVg7nsS69_T27FGxvRd6EdhtO8B_ArI8XDxtSE7R_p-1Bb_Es2x6MFOCPQxil9avft_ghJh2Bgh_HAa7FmFiw1UBVnIeaRJuRQYu0MIzY7AkUPCE3NeYfj-qciESNXF7ZhSzWLGugMe-OGe7uBGTgi3DQzbQ7IFpibfmXNAKpuGqfy2HHFmUedVA5r-54DLf6-4eSPoUA4twd9a6pWSUdpUMYMw4unnNeujTTeoScGojXKw%3D&topwindowlocation=%2Fjobs%3Fq%3Dsoftware%26l%3DTallahassee%252C%2520FL%26start%3D400%26vjk%3De2c0e89d705dbf3b", "systems": [], "languages": ["java", "javascript", "ruby", "perl"], "softwares": ["excel", "visio"], "academics": [], "buzzwords": ["web", "development", "applications", "certification", "software development", "experience"]}, "36": {"job_position": "Bioprocessing Applications Engineer - United States - Indeed.com", "job_salary": "[]", "job_type": "[]", "all_text": "\n\n\nbioprocessing applications engineer - united states - indeed.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbioprocessing applications engineer - job postscientific bioprocessing, inc.-united statesapply nowapply nowscientific bioprocessing, inc.

Tyler Technologies is a debt-free company with a history of sustained growth. During the 2008 recession, we hired and invested in both our people and products setting the stage for dramatic growth over the next decade. We are hiring during the pandemic to continue to fuel our steady growth and set the stage for our future. We are the nation\u2019s largest dedicated provider of public sector software and we recently were welcomed into the S&P 500 index (NYSE: TYL)\nSo what do our Conversion Engineers do? The SQL Conversion Engineer converts client data into Tyler\u2019s courts and justice software in a way that meets our clients\u2019 business needs.\nHow? We write SQL code. Yes, raw T-SQL code. In scripts, we write SQL in a Microsoft SQL Server environment. We are not a drag and drop shop using SSIS. We are a team of people who love to problem solve with SQL scripts. That\u2019s certainly not the only thing we do, but it is a fundamental part of it. We are not a BI shop and we don\u2019t build or populate data warehouses, we migrate data from one source system to another.\nWe have some great tools that we wrote to sequence and run the SQL we write. We are always looking to innovate and make our tools and processes more efficient. That\u2019s just how we do things here.\nThis role involves data analysis \u2013 where does this unusual data go into our database structure? \u2013 and problem solving \u2013 this client stores their financials rolled up and we need a more granular breakdown.\nWe are looking for experienced SQL developers who really love to code in T-SQL to join a very collaborative team. You\u2019ll have some very experienced folks around you and some newer folks, all of whom are learning together. No one knows everything, so we lean on each other. A lot. We share scripts, we do code reviews to help, and we have active mentoring happening every day.\nWe are part of something bigger than ourselves at Tyler. We are making government more effective and efficient in how they run their local justice system. What we do saves taxpayers money and provides more access to justice for everyone.\nWe work with our integrated solutions that help courts and public safety organizations of all sizes better protect and serve the public. By helping provide solutions that improve efficiency and response time, you can help serve our citizens and make communities safer.\nResponsibilities\nDid we already say writing SQL? Yeah, we write a lot of SQL on this job. This can be complex SQL, not just your run of the mill SQL. The data model is large and complex with a lot to learn. If you don\u2019t like writing SQL by hand, this is not a good fit for you. If you love it, read on.\nWe do data analysis on each project, so you\u2019ll need to be good at piecing together data puzzles, asking discerning questions, and working with colleagues and clients to get answers\nWe have a custom toolset we built. We want you to learn it, use it, and tell us how we can improve it.\nWe have some solid processes that have been honed through 15 years of doing data conversions. We want you to learn these processes \u2013 because they really do work \u2013 and then work with us on finding ways to improve them or replace them with better ways to do our work.\nDatabase backups, restores, creating indexes, shrinking databases \u2013 we consider these types of operations basic to what we do. You will be expected to do these things and understand when, why, and how to do them.\nWork in SQL Server environments. We work with multiple versions of SQL Server depending upon the project. We usually cover the current release of SQL Server and two earlier releases.\nSome of us work on Azure projects, so familiarity with that may be helpful.\nQualifications\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science, Management Information Systems (MIS), or related field or relevant work experience; no degree, no problem as long as you know your stuff.\nYou should value deadlines and regularly complete work on time\nYou should be a strong problem solver\nExcellent interpersonal skills including verbal and written communication, teamwork, and customer service skills.\nTechnical knowledge requirements:\nProficiently use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)\nWrite and maintain stored procedures and functions using T-SQL and SSMS\nUse aggregate functions in Microsoft SQL Server\nCreate and maintain complex queries in Microsoft SQL Server using T-SQL\nUnderstand and use database schemas, tables, relationships, and constraints\nDevelop, maintain, and troubleshoot conversion packages\nA few of us also write Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports from time to time\nEven fewer of us dabble in application development\n#DICECJ\n#INDCJTyler Technologies - 30+ days agoreport job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "embedded_url": "https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?viewtype=embedded&jk=cd1f73fd58c81b2e&from=vjs&tk=1em2spqs1p88r801&advn=2970234826161810&adid=359899047&ad=-6NYlbfkN0CeE3Wp1M-8tH35RiH3f1Z9bIMggqs9mWwktycFHRXbIYXiJtbRplKkPbn_dzogpyf0G9iHocoRXODxpB5w5uKtjVopFg1lsu7hSbuwPTngfTjPouUN1N6H6MWY4fAsMyejkqmPsWMl-EHjflFYzmfQ-6z2nNRdfceK5wzK_0UOE_LNu1Y_iG5U10BXiBEcJdJBk2CkUMkfPOlSn4IowzgLm_sAcdikL0gw338igFz67uKZix1Uin7scXheVjkUdyl6Py8VpfgXi48UcQNks86ObuHA8-oCBDSPiCwPEFXfpC-aPrVoyJcKwZYmlQvM8OkePm0NND-uMYz4GvQb5L1dIxb1GHGvr-urcgoD4QEKWmzYAh_dRdD2_fZkaKhCSPVg_F02YrK-VOpvxyILvokBa66wha0UbfWl5dcUIb-H89m6PRjJ6E6Gn9wYIvXEObnbX9MdyZtlljl225oNc5OWDvCu2YaZ9_Hfz9edr7p9yA%3D%3D&topwindowlocation=%2Fjobs%3Fq%3Dsoftware%26l%3DTallahassee%252C%2520FL%26start%3D280%26vjk%3Dc227c53b78c0cfb1%26advn%3D6510866399140038", "systems": ["azure"], "languages": [], "softwares": ["excel"], "academics": ["bachelor"], "buzzwords": ["development", "microsoft", "data analysis", "experience"]}, "93": {"job_position": "Work From Home Credentialed Tax Professional - Tallahassee, FL 32313 - Indeed.com", "job_salary": "[]", "job_type": "[]", "all_text": "\n\n\nWork From Home Credentialed Tax Professional - Tallahassee, FL 32313 - Indeed.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork From Home Credentialed Tax Professional - job postIntuit1,483 reviews-Tallahassee, FL 32313\u2022RemoteIntuit1,483 reviewsRead what people are saying about working here.Apply On Company SiteApply On Company SiteOverview\nIf you are a highly motivated individual with an active unrestricted credential (CPA/EA/Practicing Attorney) and excellent communication skills, we need you to help our customers complete their taxes using Intuit TurboTax products.

Please do not call our company number since you will reach a dispatch department who sets up work orders and they do not have any part of the hiring process.Our techs get assigned work by email and they complete forms online to validate it. This work is VERY consequential with enterprise level companies keeping score in their unique ways. While this eliminates about 96% of other providers, we have been in business since 2006, and started this version of service in 2014, enjoying 100% growth per year.We, as a team, achieve 98% or better ratings. This raises our pay rates and work load and secures promotions along the way for our techs.Our techs start out as \"junior techs\" at $13/h, and get a $1/h raise for every 10 work orders completed up to $20. This is intended to take a month based on the tech's availability and the work load offered given a techs location and skill.Techs average 2-3 work orders a day, averaging 2-3 hours each. These usually fall during normal business hours. Calls after 7pm or before 7am are paid 150%.Techs also get reimbursed for materials at local rates (Home Depot, Best Buy etc.) and we encourage techs to own their own business. We support your growth in any way that does not directly compete with our business model which is providing local tech to enterprise level companies through software.Successful techs will quickly be promoted to leads. Lead techs are usually promoted to Administration in about 6 months if they have the skillets. Administrators work with our clients and enjoy more than 20% of revenue of the jobs they manage.Any tech who has been an in administration for at least 1 year is able to buy their market for any appraised value, so long as the business appraisal is from someone with a legitimate history. We support your ownership by helping techs pay for this from their increased earnings.At Cook:You are working for and then with the BEST techs in the market, who are supportive of your growth.You have access to training and get hands on experience with EVERY SINGLE part of the tech business. We work on printers, networks, servers, kitchen & menu display systems, satellites, security alarms, and much much more.
